\subsection{Feature Diagrams}

show running example as a feature diagram with cross-tree-constraints

explain notation

lego example?

discuss pros/cons

\subsection{Propositional Formulas}

why is this needed? (forward ref?)

show running example as a formula

explain intuition behind elements of formula

\subsection{Transforming Diagrams into Formulas}

formal algorithm for transformation into FOL (and then CNF?)

+ example

\subsection{Other Representations}

list of products, excel sheet, no explicit model (in motivation?), grammars, \dots

variations of feature models (e.g. cardinalities, non-boolean)

discuss pros/cons
