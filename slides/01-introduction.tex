\section{Introduction to Product Lines}

\input{content/01a-productlines}

\lessonslearned{
	\item mass customization\\= mass production + customization
	\item features, products, domains
	\item software product lines
	\item product-line engineering
}{
	\item \fospl, Chapter~1\mypages{3--15} --- introduction close to this lecture, further examples
	\item \seiwhitepaperspl\mypages{2--8} --- what is not a product line?
	% TODO add further reference? \sple\mypage{14}
}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What other examples of product lines do you know?
		\item Exemplify the differences between feature, product, domain, and product line for these examples.
		\item Are these product lines related to software?
	\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges of Product Lines}

\input{content/01b-challenges}

\lessonslearned{
	\item why are product lines challenging?
	\item selected challenges:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item software clones
		\item feature traceability
		\item automated generation
		\item combinatorial explosion
		\item feature interactions
		\item continuous growth
		\end{enumerate}
}{
	\item[] see later lectures
}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Form groups of 2--3 students
		\item Explain 2--3 of the six challenges to your colleagues
		\item Can you find own examples for these challenges?
	\end{itemize}

\inputuniversity{content/01c-course}

\lessonslearned{
	\item focus: how to implement features
	\item focus: how to model valid combinations
	\item focus: how to do quality assurance
	\item prerequisites, course overview, formalities

	\item \featureide\ --- more practical guide on tool support
}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ask questions on the course organization!
		\item Form teams for the practical tasks.
	\end{itemize}
