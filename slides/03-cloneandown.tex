\section{Compile-Time Variability and Clone-and-Own}

\input{content/03a-intro}

\lessonslearned{
	\item Compile-time variability is decided before or at compile time
	\item In Clone-and-Own, new variants of a software system are created by copying and adapting an existing variant
	\item Simple paradigm, but suffering from maintenance problems in the long run
}{
	\item[] % TODO add literature pointers
}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What are the reasons why clone-and-own is very popular in practice?
		\item What is the order of magnitude of the number of variants that can be reasonably maintained in clone-and-own?
		\item Have you ever applied the principle of clone-and-own? If so, where and how? 
	\end{itemize}
}

\section{Clone-and-Own with Version Control}

\input{content/03b-versioncontrol}

\lessonslearned{
	\item Software configuration management as a traditional discipline of managing the evolution of variability-intensive systems
	\item Version control systems as a widespread tool supporting clone-and-own in practice
}{
	\item \fospl, Chapter 5.1
}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Which software configuration management concepts are supported by version control systems?
		\item Do you know other version control systems than Git? 
		\item If so, in which way are they different from Git? 
	\end{itemize}
}

\section{Clone-and-Own with Build Systems}

\input{content/03c-buildsystems}

\lessonslearned{
	\item Variability through build scripts
	\item Granularity of clones: Individual files
	\item Combination of files $\neq$ combination of features
}{
	\item \fospl, Chapter 5.1
}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Which software configuration management concepts are supported by build systems?
		\item What are the commonalities and differences of clone-and-own with version control and clone-and-own with build systems?
		\item What are the strengths and weaknesses?
	\end{itemize}
