% TODO add quote on clone and own
% \mycite{Suppose you are developing a new system that seems very similar to one you have built before. You borrow what you can from your previous effort, modify it as necessary, add whatever it takes, and field the product, which then assumes its own maintenance trajectory separate from that of the first product. What you have done is what is called “clone and own.” You certainly have taken economic advantage of previous work; you have reused a part of another system. But now you have two entirely different systems, not two systems built from the same base. This is again ad hoc reuse.}

\section{Compile-Time Variability and Clone-and-Own}

\input{content/03a-intro}

\lessonslearned{
	\item Compile-time variability is decided before or at compile time.
	\item In Clone-and-Own, new variants of a software system are created by copying and adapting an existing variant.
	\item Simple paradigm, but suffering from maintenance problems in the long run.
}{
	\item \todo{\ldots}
}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What are the reasons why clone-and-own is very popular in practice?
		\item What is the order of magnitude of the number of variants that can be reasonably maintained in clone-and-own?
		\item Have you ever applied the principle of clone-and-own? If so, where and how?

	\item \fospl, Chapter 5.1
}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Which Software Configuration Management concepts are supported by Version Control Systems?
		\item Do you know other version control systems than Git? 
		\item If so, in which way are they different from Git?
