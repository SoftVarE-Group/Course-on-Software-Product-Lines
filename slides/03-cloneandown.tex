\section{Compile-Time Variability and Clone-and-Own}

\input{content/03a-intro}

\lessonslearned{
	\item Compile-time variability is decided before or at compile time
	\item In clone-and-own, new variants of a software system are created by copying and adapting an existing variant
	\item Simple paradigm, but suffering from maintenance problems in the long run
}{
	\item\fospl\mychapter{3.1.1}\mypages{48--49}\\--- brief introduction of compile-time variability
	\item\softwareclonedetection\mysection{2}\mypages{1167--1168}\\--- brief introduction to software clones, their types, reasons, (dis)advantages
	\item\virtualplatform\ --- brief introduction to ad-hoc clone-and-own (L0)
	% TODO better literature pointers on clone-and-own?
}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What are the reasons why clone-and-own is very popular in practice?
		\item What is the order of magnitude of the number of variants that can be reasonably maintained in clone-and-own?
		\item Have you ever applied the principle of clone-and-own? If so, where and how? 
	\end{itemize}

\section{Clone-and-Own with Version Control}

\input{content/03b-versioncontrol}

\lessonslearned{
	\item Software configuration management as a traditional discipline of managing the evolution of variability-intensive systems
	\item Version control systems as a widespread tool supporting clone-and-own in practice
}{
	\item \fospl\mychapter{5.1}\mypages{99--105}\\--- introduction of variability with version control (not~explicitly calling it clone-and-own)
	\item \staplesandhill\ --- experience report on managed clone-and-own with version control and build systems
	\item\virtualplatform\ --- brief introduction to clone-and-own with version control (L1)
	% TODO add literature? \summerville\mychapter{25}
}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Which software configuration management concepts are supported by version control systems?
		\item Do you know other version control systems than Git? 
		\item If so, in which way are they different from Git? 
	\end{itemize}
}

\section{Clone-and-Own with Build Systems}

\input{content/03c-buildsystems}

\lessonslearned{
	\item Variability through build scripts
	\item Granularity of clones: Individual files
	\item Combination of files\\$\neq$ combination of features
}{
	\item \fospl\mychapter{5.2.2 and 5.2.4}\mypages{106--110}\\--- brief introduction of clone-and-own with build systems (not~explicitly calling it clone-and-own)
	\item \staplesandhill\ --- experience report on managed clone-and-own with version control and build systems
}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Which software configuration management concepts are supported by build systems?
		\item What are the commonalities and differences of clone-and-own with version control and clone-and-own with build systems?
		\item What are the strengths and weaknesses?
		% TODO \item What is the effort to convert ad-hoc clone-and-own into managed clone-and-own?
	\end{itemize}
