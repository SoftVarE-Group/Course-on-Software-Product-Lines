\section{Feature Models}

\input{content/04a-notation}

\lessonslearned{
	\item features, dependencies between features, configurators
	\item feature models: abstract and concrete features, tree and cross-tree constraints
	\item tree constraints: optional, mandatory, or group, alternative group
}{
	\item \fospl, Section~2.3 Feature Modeling

}{
	\item sketch a feature model with \todo{X} configurations (pen and paper preferred)
	\item upload your solution to \todots
	\item discuss whether your solutions are syntactically correct and have the right number of configurations

\section{Representations and Translations}

\input{content/04b-representations}

\lessonslearned{
	\item To understand large configuration spaces, formal semantics and machine-readable representations matter.
	\item Propositional formulas satisfy many (though not all) needs for such a representation.

}{
	\item Figure out how many valid configurations your feature diagram represents.
	When is this easy?
	\item Translate (a part of) your feature diagram into a formula, then into CNF, and finally into a DIMACS file.
	How might this be useful?

% third: analyses of feature models (what can a computer tell us, which we cannot tell just by looking?)
\section{Automated Analyses}

\input{content/04c-analyses}

\lessonslearned{
	\item Automated SAT-based analyses help in understanding large configuration spaces.
	\item There are still many open problems regarding encodings and applications (e.g., \#SAT).

	% alternative: find inconsistencies in your feature diagram
	\item Recall that some $f \in F$ is dead iff $\pnot SAT(\phi \pand f)$.
	Suppose you want to know \emph{all} dead features of $\phi$.
	Naively, you may formulate $\abs{F}$ SAT queries.
	
	Can this be improved?
	
	(Hint: Some SAT solvers return an example model $M_\psi$ when $\psi$ is satisfiable.)
