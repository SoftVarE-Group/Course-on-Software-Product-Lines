\section{Features with Build Systems}

\input{content/05a-buildsystems}

\lessonslearned{
	\item ad-hoc variability is lacking
	\item features with build systems allow for automated generation of products and free feature selection
	\item build systems include entire files, not lines or chunks
}{
	\item \fospl, Section~5.2 Build Systems
	% TODO add work on KernelHaven
}{
	Choose a build system and sketch how it may be used to implement this SPL (file structure and build script):

\section{Features with Preprocessors}

\input{content/05b-preprocessors}

\lessonslearned{
	\item granularity of variability at file level is not sufficient
	\item preprocessors facilitate fine-grained variability within files
	\item a widely applied preprocessor is the C Preprocessor
	\item industrial systems often combine preprocessors and build systems for features
}{
	\item \fospl, Section~5.3 Preprocessors
}{
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Antenna performs an in-place transformation on implementation artifacts.
		What might be the benefits of using an in-place approach? Do you see any drawbacks?
		\item The preprocessors we have seen so far are also called lexical preprocessors.
		What is emphasized by the notion of lexical and can you think of other preprocessing approaches?
		\item The literature on software product lines has coined the term ``\#ifdef hell''.
		What could be meant with this?

\section{Feature Traceability}

\input{content/05c-traceability}

\lessonslearned{
	\item preprocessor variability suffers from scattering and tangling
	\item feature traceability can be established with tool support (e.g., Feature Commander)
	\item virtual separation of concerns is an alternative to preprocessors (e.g., CIDE)
}{
	\item \fospl, Section~3.2.2 Feature Traceability
	\item \fospl, Section~7 Advanced, Tool-Driven Variability Mechanisms
}{
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Why is it beneficial to have feature traceability even for single systems?
		\item Using disciplined annotations, only optional nodes in the abstract syntax tree can be annotated (i.e., assigned to features); if we remove them, no syntax error occurs. What are examples of optional and non-optional (i.e., mandatory) types of nodes in Java?
