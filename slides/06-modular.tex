\section{Components}

\input{content/06a-components}

\lessonslearned{
	\item Modularity = information hiding and data encapsulation
	\item Components foster a modular software architecture and design
	\item Reuse within and beyond product lines
	\item No automated product derivation, glue code is necessary
}{
	\item \szyperski
	\item \fospl, Chapter 4.4
}{
	\item Consider the feature traceability problem in a component-based implementation. How would you localize a feature? Does it still suffer from scattering, tangling and replication? 
	\item We have introduced a simple color component which we reused in our graph implementation. Could we consider the graph library itself as another component? What about its reusability?
	\item How can product-line engineering help to find the right trade-offs regarding the library scaling problem?

\section{Services and Microservices}

\input{content/06b-services}

\lessonslearned{
	\item Services are another kind of module implemented and operated independently of each other 
	\item Microservices have a clear philosophy regarding their size, driven by organizational constraints
	\item Reuse within and beyond product lines
	\item No automated product derivation, orchestration or choreography is necessary
}{
	\item \fospl, Chapter 4.4
}{
	\item We have talked a lot about promises of microservices. Do you also see any drawbacks?
	\item In a component-based product-line implementation, practitioners often rely on clone-and-own for glue code. How could we handle variability in service orchestrations?

\section{Frameworks with Plug-Ins}

\input{content/06c-frameworks}

\lessonslearned{
	\item A framework is open to extension by integrating plug-ins at explicit hot spots.
	\item The framework takes full control over all plug-ins (load-time and run-time).
	\item Enables full automation but requires preplanning effort.
}{
	\item \fospl, Chapter 4.3
}{
	\item Remember two fundamental principles in object-oriented programming; how do they relate to frameworks with plug-ins?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Interface Segregation Principle: ``Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use''.
		\item Open-Closed Principle: ``Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification''.
	\end{itemize}
	\item In general: Where are the limitations of a modular approach?
