\section{What is a Feature Interaction?}

\input{content/09a-interactions}

\lessonslearned{
	\item feature interaction and feature-interaction problem
	\item wanted/unwanted, static/dynamic, one-wise/pair-wise/higher-order
	\item examples: customization of clothes, Android apps, toaster, preprocessor code, runtime variability, Variability Bug Database
}{
	\item \fospl\ Chapter 9 \mypages{213--217}
}{
	Do you know further examples of feature interactions?

\section{How to Handle Feature Interactions?}

\input{content/09b-handlinginteractions}

\lessonslearned{
	\item Adaptation of feature model to avoid (undesired) feature interactions. 
	\item Strategies to implement coordination code for known feature interactions.
	\item Discussion of the strenghts and weaknesses of each of the strategies.
}{
	\item Kästner et al.: On the impact of the optional feature problem: Analysis and case studies. SPLC 2009.
	\item \fospl, Chapter 9
}{
	Looking back at our graph library and the feature interaction between $ShortestPath$ and $Weighted$. Which strategy would you choose to handle this interaction? Why?
	
	Can you think of other feature interactions for the graph library (you may also add additional features)? Again, how would you handle them?

\section{How to Avoid Feature Interactions?}
