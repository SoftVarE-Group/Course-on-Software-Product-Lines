\section{Analysis Strategies}

\input{content/10a-strategies}

\lessonslearned{
	\item product-line analyses are needed for quality assurance
	\item \emph{product-based}: simple, but does not scale
	\item \emph{feature-based}: fairly simple, but misses interactions
	\item \emph{family-based}: efficient, but most complex
}{
	\item \fospl, Chapter 10
	\item \analysisstrategies
}{
	Can you imagine other analysis strategies than product-based, feature-based, and family-based?
	How could such strategies look like?

\section{Analyzing Feature Mappings}

\input{content/10b-mapping}

\lessonslearned{
	\item feature-mapping analyses alleviate the impact of code scattering and tangling
	\item they are usually not necessary when there is good feature traceability
	\item they cannot detect bugs in the actual code
}{
	\item \fospl, Chapter 10
}{
	Above, we assumed that we know all presence conditions already.
	How can we automatically extract presence conditions from code that uses the C preprocessor?
	What problems might occur?
	% - there might be #includes that contain macro definitions
	% - there might be macros to be expanded, which can get complex quickly
	% - it is not always trivial to distinguish feature macros from compiler- or system-specific macros
	% - there is #undef (or re-#define), which opens another can of worms
	% see works on TypeChef (C. Kästner), SuperC (P. Gazillo), FeatureCoPP (K. Ludwig), PCLocator (E. Kuiter)

\section{Analyzing Variable Code}

\input{content/10c-code}

\lessonslearned{
	\item with family-based analyses of variable code, we can analyze (non-)functional properties of all products at once
	\item type checking all products at once is possible for product lines up to medium size
	\item for huge product lines (e.g., Linux), it is infeasible
}{
	\item \fospl, Chapter 10
	\item \typechef
}{
	Suppose you have a preprocessor-based product line (with \texttt{\#ifdef}'s).
	If you could turn it into a single, large runtime-variable product (with \texttt{if}'s), you could use an off-the-shelf compiler to find any type error in any product.

	Is this possible? What problems might occur?
