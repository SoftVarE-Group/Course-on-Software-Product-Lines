\subsection{Prepare for the Exam}

\begin{frame}{\myframetitle}
	\begin{mycolumns}
		\mydefinition{Our Oral Exam}{
			\begin{itemize}
				\item takes $\approx 20$ minutes
				\item starts with questions on lectures 1 and 4
				\item for lectures 2, 3, and 5--7, you draw a random implementation technique, which you have to explain and discuss
				\item then you draw another technique, which you have to compare to the first
				\item finally, some questions on lectures 8--12
			\end{itemize}
		}
	\mynextcolumn
		\mynote{Tips}{
			\begin{itemize}
				\item if you have questions, ask them now
				\item for practicing, answer the questions on the slides above
				\item also use the exam preparation material posted on Elearning
				\item review the exercise tasks
				\item ``roleplay'' an oral exam with a fellow student
			\end{itemize}
		}
	\end{mycolumns}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Take More Courses}

\begin{frame}{\myframetitle}
	\begin{mycolumns}[t]
		\mynote{Student Conference}{
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Master course in the summer term
				\item you will learn how to write a (short) scientific paper on a given topic
				\item usually a literature survey on database or software engineering topics
				\item three draft milestones, two review rounds, two presentations
				\item lectures on academic writing, the publication process, and research ethics
				\item recommended for those who pursue an academic career or want to practice for writing a thesis
			\end{itemize}
		}
	\mynextcolumn
		\mynote{Scientific Team Project}{
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Bachelor/Master course in the summer term
				\item you will conduct a small research project on a database topic
				\item includes a literature survey and implementation
				\item summarized in a project report
				\item difference to student conference: less focus on academic (thesis) writing, more on implementation and team collaboration
			\end{itemize}
		}
		\mynote{}{individual projects also possible}
	\end{mycolumns}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Write Your Thesis}

\begin{frame}{\myframetitle}
	\begin{mycolumns}[t]
		\mynote{Openings for Bachelor/Master Theses}{
			\begin{itemize}
				\item our thesis topics focus on potential new research contributions
				\item industry collaborations possible if there is a relation to our research
				\item example thesis topics \href{https://www.uni-ulm.de/fileadmin/website_uni_ulm/iui.inst.170/projects/spldev/thesis_topics_22-06-29.pdf}{here} (most taken)
				\item if interested, contact Elias at \href{mailto:kuiter@ovgu.de}{kuiter@ovgu.de}
			\end{itemize}
		}
	\mynextcolumn
		\mynote{Open Position for Research Assistant}{
			\begin{itemize}
				\item we are searching for a student interested in contributing to the new FeatureIDE library
				\item you are: an excellent Java developer familiar with (or willing to familiarize with) modern Java constructs (lambdas, streams, futures)
				\item if interested, contact Elias at \href{mailto:kuiter@ovgu.de}{kuiter@ovgu.de}
