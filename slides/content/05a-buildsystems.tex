\subsection{How to Implement Features?}
% what we have: feature models, configurations
% what we want: automated generation of products based on configuration + compile-time variability
% central question for the next three lectures

\subsection{Problems of Ad-Hoc Approaches for Variability}
\subsubsection{Features with Runtime Variability}
% feature model used to create valid configuration
% configuration used to generate global variables/configuration files/runtime parameters
% automated generation, but no compile-time variability

\subsubsection{Features with Clone-and-Own?}
% compile-time variability, but ...
% no automated generation with version control
% automated generation with build systems but no features

\subsection{Introducing Features to Build Systems}

\subsection{KBuild}

\subsection{Discussion of Features with Build Systems}

\subsection{Granularity of Variability}
% Christian's paper?
% empirical studies?
% essence: file-level variability is not engough
