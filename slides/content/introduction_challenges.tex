\subsection{Code Clones}
% cloning in the large, considered harmful
% clone-and-own: even more problematic

\subsection{Feature Traceability}
% definition
% traceability

\subsection{Automated Generation}
% how to automatically generate products given a descriptive selection of features?

\subsection{Combinatorial Explosion}
% huge configuration spaces
% expoential grows (in the number of features)
% not all combinations valid
% how to model valid combinations?

\subsection{Feature Interactions}
% typically unknown in advance
% quality assurance/correctness necessary

%\subsection{Incompatible Features}
%% hidden in Ebay, grayed out in Amazon, hints for Lenovo
%\subsection{Compound Features}
%% software for Lenovo, ...
%\subsection{Automated Reconfiguration}
%% BMW, Toyota
%\subsection{Interactive Resolution of Conflicts}
%% Lenovo, Toyota
%\subsection{}

\subsection{Continuous Growth}
% evolution: number of features/variants increases
% number of features grows over time: picture on linux from ulm slides
% law?

%\subsection{Maintainability}
% maintenance of preprocessor code?

% costs: development, investment, maintenance, logistic, production
% customer needs?
