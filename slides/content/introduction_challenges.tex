			\begin{itemize}
				\item Continuing Change: systems must be continually adapted to stay satisfactory % E-type systems must be continually adapted else they become progressively less satisfactorv.
				\item Increasing Complexity: complexity increases during evolution unless work is done to maintain or reduce it % As an E-type system evolves its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it.
				%\item Self Regulation: %E-type system evolution process is self regulating with distribution of product and process measures close to normal.
				%\item Conservation of Organizational Stability (invariant work rate): %The average effective global activity rate in an evolving E-type system is invariant over product lifetime.
				%\item Conservation of Familiarity: satisfactory evolution excludes excessive growth %As an E-type system evolves all associated with it, developers, sales personnel, users, for example, must maintain mastery of its content and behaviour to achieve satisfactory evolution. Excessive growth diminishes that mastery. Hence the average incremental growth remains invariant as the system evolves.
				\item Continuing Growth: functionality must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction %The functional content of E-type systems must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over their lifetime.
				\item Declining Quality: quality will decline unless rigorously maintained and adapted to operational environment changes %The quality of E-type systems will appear to be declining unless they are rigorously maintained and adapted to operational environment changes.
				%\item Feedback System: %E-type evolution processes constitute multi-level, multi-loop, multi-agent feedback systems and must be treated as such to achieve significant improvement over any reasonable base.
