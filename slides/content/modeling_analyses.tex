this section should teach all usual FM/cfg analyses - some in more detail, some only high-level (other SPL analyses come in analyses.tex)

revisit what the class of programs named "solver" does, and why it is important that we use OTS solvers and profit from their optimizations/contests - idea: reduce practical problems to solvers (sim. to TheoInf/Logics)
only with Boolean formulas can we get really performant results today

extensions to simple SAT solvers (maybe explain when needed):
- when SAT = true, some give a satisfying assignment (for optimizations)
- wen SAT = false, some give a MUS (for explanations)
- some can count, called sharp SAT (or keep them completely separated from SAT?) (for model counting)

ask questions:
am i developing unused code?
how to find out whether a partial configuration is valid? (show decision propagation in FeatureIDE)

for each analysis, also list the sharp SAT encoding

as interaction at the end: how can we leverage when a SAT solver also gives us a sat-assignment?

proposal (explain with one running example):

Q: is the FM consistent?
Tool: SAT (explain)
A: SAT(FM)

Q: is a feature core/dead?
Tool: SAT
A: not SAT(FM and not F) etc.

Q: WHY is this the case?
Tool: SAT-MUS (explain)
A: ...

Q: to WHICH DEGREE is a FM consistent (i.e., degree of freedom / variability factor) or a feature core/dead?
Tool: sharp SAT (explain)
A: ...

(then list some other analyses quickly)

on a summary page, state that sharp SAT > 0 implies SAT, SAT-MUS iff SAT
then, as an interaction, explain what SAT-ASS is and ask how it can be used
this way, students are taught that SAT* solvers are tools for answering questions, and that if they support more features, more/faster analyses are possible
