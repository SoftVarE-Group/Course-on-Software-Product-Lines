% FEATURE: should be defined in intro chapter

\subsection{Motivation}

%this section shall give a clear motivation (making tacit knowledge explicit)/some application examples (analysis (some example questions, see Berger et al. for motivation of these questions), communication, knowledge managament/transfer), include the FODA notation and show FeatureIDE examples (without analysis)
%=> how do we get from ad-hoc to our vision?

\subsection{Features in Online Configurators}

\subsection{Dependencies Between Features}

% \subsection{Features in Industrial Practice}

% better: Excel table of products or features/dependencies

% give some experience reports/motivation from practice (Berger et al)

% (maybe mention Marlin case study about Feature Location?)

% \subsection{Feature Models and Configurations}

% even better: show examples of structured configuration processes (eg. subway, Linux)

% then define feature model + configuration and give examples

\subsection{Feature Diagrams} % syntax, notation, visuals

\begin{frame}{~}
show running example as a feature diagram with cross-tree-constraints

explain notation (formal semantics later)

discuss pros/cons

show diagram in some established tools: FeatureIDE, pure::variants

FMs describe features and their dependencies explicitly - tease (in)valid configurations (interaction?)
\end{frame}

% TODO move?
%\subsection{Implicit Knowledge About Features}
%
%usually, features + constraints are not modeled explicitly (tacit knowledge / lost in code) => pros/cons
