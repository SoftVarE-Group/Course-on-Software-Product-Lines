this section shall give a clear motivation (making tacit knowledge explicit)/some application examples (analysis (some example questions, see Berger et al. for motivation of these questions), communication, knowledge managament/transfer), include the FODA notation and show FeatureIDE examples (without analysis)

show a FM visually, formal treatment later

FMs describe features and their dependencies explicitly - tease (in)valid configurations (interaction?), formal treatment later

do a FeatureIDE demo as an interaction





FEATURE: should be defined in intro chapter

is "feature" already defined/explained at this point?

\subsection{Implicit Knowledge About Features}

usually, features are not modeled explicitly (tacit knowledge / lost in code) => pros/cons

\subsection{Features in Industrial Practice}

better: Excel table of products or features/dependencies

give some experience reports/motivation from practice (Berger et al)

(maybe mention Marlin case study about Feature Location?)

\subsection{Feature Models and Configurations}

even better: show examples of structured configuration processes (eg. subway, Linux)

then define feature model + configuration and give examples

\subsection{Feature Diagrams}

show running example as a feature diagram with cross-tree-constraints

explain notation

lego example?
