\section{Analysis Strategies}
\input{content/10a-strategies}
\lessonslearned{
	\item product-line analyses are needed for quality assurance
	\item \emph{product-based}: simple, but does not scale
	\item \emph{feature-based}: fairly simple, but misses interactions
	\item \emph{family-based}: efficient, but most complex
}{
	\item \fospl\mychapter{10}
	\item \analysisstrategies
}{
	Can you imagine other analysis strategies than product-based, feature-based, and family-based?
	How could such strategies look like?
}

\section{Analyzing Feature Mappings}
\input{content/10b-mapping}
\lessonslearned{
	\item feature-mapping analyses alleviate the impact of code scattering and tangling
	\item they are usually not necessary when there is good feature traceability
	\item they cannot detect bugs in the actual code
}{
	\item \fospl\mychapter{10}
}{
	Above, we assumed that we know all presence conditions already.
	How can we automatically extract presence conditions from code that uses the C preprocessor?
	What problems might occur?
	% - there might be #includes that contain macro definitions
	% - there might be macros to be expanded, which can get complex quickly
	% - it is not always trivial to distinguish feature macros from compiler- or system-specific macros
	% - there is #undef (or re-#define), which opens another can of worms
	% see works on TypeChef (C. Kästner), SuperC (P. Gazillo), FeatureCoPP (K. Ludwig), PCLocator (E. Kuiter)
}

\section{Analyzing Variable Code}
\input{content/10c-code}
\lessonslearned{
	\item with family-based analyses of variable code, we can analyze (non-)functional properties of all products at once
	\item type checking all products at once is possible for product lines up to medium size
	\item for huge product lines (e.g., Linux), it is infeasible
}{
	\item \fospl\mychapter{10}
	\item \typechef
}{
	Suppose you have a preprocessor-based product line (with \texttt{\#ifdef}'s).
	If you could turn it into a single, large runtime-variable product (with \texttt{if}'s), you could use an off-the-shelf compiler to find any type error in any product.

	Is this possible? What problems might occur?
}

\faq{
	\item How to find variability bugs?
	\item What is a program analysis? What are examples?
	\item What is a product-line analysis?
	\item What are principal strategies to analyze product lines? What are (dis-)advantages?
	\item Given a specific algorithm, classify its analysis strategy!
}{
	\item How to analyze feature mappings?
	\item What are potential problems in feature mappings?
	\item What are presence conditions, dead code, superfluous annotations?
	\item Shall we incorporate the feature model when analyzing feature mappings?
	\item Shall product-line analyses analyze problem and solution space separately?
	\item What is special when analyzing the feature mapping of feature modules?
	\item What are limitations of analyzing feature mappings?
	\item Given CPP source code, determine its presence conditions, dead code, and superfluous annotations!
}{
	\item What are (examples of) type errors?
	\item Why are type errors challenging to detect in product lines?
	\item What is a type-safe product line, reachability condition, conflict condition?
	\item How does the analysis complexity differ for real-world product lines?
	\item What are analyses for problem and solution space?
	\item Give examples for easy and difficult product lines in terms of analysis effort!
